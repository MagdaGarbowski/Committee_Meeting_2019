## Agenda
* Discuss plan for dissertation chapters
    + Chapter 1: Traits of restoration species vary by ontogenetic stage 
    + Chapter 2: Responses of cultivars and natural accessions of *Elymus trachycaulus* to drought and competition 
    + Chapter 3: Options 
        - Second manuscript from MS project
        - Outdoor *E trachycaulus* study (if independent of Ch. 2)
        - Review: Root traits in ecological restoration  
* Involvement of committee members in preparing manuscripts  
* Set defense date? 

## Chapter 1: Traits by developmental stage

![Means and 90% credible intervals of species' specific leaf area and specific root length at different developmental stages. Diamonds in shades of grey are grasses, circles in shades of blue are forbs.](/Users/MagdaGarbowski/CommitteeMeeting/SLA_SRL_HComparison_Figures.pdf){ width=80%, height=60% }


## Chapter 2: Responses of cultivars and natural accessions of *Elymus trachycaulus* to drought and competition  

![Means of aboveground and belowground biomass +/- SE of the mean for five of nine accessions of *E. trachycaulus* under control and drought (Experiment 1, 24 Day Harvest). Accession x treatment interaction observed only aboveground. Accessions beginning with CULT are cultivars.](/Users/MagdaGarbowski/CommitteeMeeting/TUCD_h2_Control_Drought.pdf){ width=50%, height=50% }

## Chapter 3: Options 
* Option 1: Manuscript from second part of MS project in which we assessed the effects of *B tectorum* (cheatgrass), drought, and super-absorbent polymer on developing plant communities and soil moisture. Submitted to Ecosphere. 
* Option 2: Split Chapter 2 into two chapters 
* Option 3: Review of "How root traits can inform ecological restoration".
